# Exercise-Navigation-2

In this exercise you will work with **modal** presentations.

## Tasks
1. Create a new project for this exercise.
2. Add a UIButton to a UIViewController that will modally present another UIViewController.
3. Pass a NSString to the modal UIViewController and display it on the screen.
4. Add a UIBarButtonItem to the modal UIViewController to dimiss it from code.
5. Add a UIBarButtonItem to the modal UIViewController to unwind.
6. Repeat the previous task for each **modal presentation style**.
  - There should be 1 UIButton + 1 UIViewController per modal presentation style.
  - Tip: not all modal presentation styles are visible on the iPhone.
7. Investigate the different **modal transition styles**.
  - This can be done by making the background view of the modal UIViewController transparent. Tip: alpha.

## Solutions
The solutions are available in the **oplossing** branch of this repository.
